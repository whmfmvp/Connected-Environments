# Connected-Environments
Hey Duncan, this is Haoming Wang(Axe). I'll introduce what I have learned and skills develped from the project plant monitor.

Here we go
Firstly, set up feather. I downloaded the Arduino IDE and plug in my Huzzah to a USB port.

Then I use the given code to connect the lab wifi CE-hub-student with Arduino, it works.
After that, I went to the libraries and downloaded the ezTime library, when I opened the serial monitor, real time data could appear!


On the workshop, Duncan taught us how to solder by showing the process on the screen. Actually, it was my first time doing things like this, I studied marketing when I was an undergraduate, so basically I have no idea about how to solder objects by using machine and wire.

With the help of video and other classmates, I started to do it by myself. To be honest, it's not really hard and also interesting! 
But be careful!!! 
When the machine turned on, the temperature is around 400 celsius, a very high figure so that it can melted wire. And when finished soldering, we should put the solder head back to the rest place, then stand up to offer next student to use the machine, do not pass the solder head to others by hand directly!!

This is my masterpiece, I connected the stitches to the board, although it looks not really nice, but it is very stable! I'm satisfied as professors always said "learning through doing". People always feel excited when they learn something new!

Next stage, I added 4 electric resistance to the board, which are two 10w, one 100w and one 200w. When I inserted these to the board, I should put them in the right position of the board, cut the remaining wire and soldered them as well. DHT22 is the sensor that we use in this project, which could help us to detect the environment temperature and moisture around the plant.
